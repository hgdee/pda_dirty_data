1.1 Task 1 - Decathlon Data
This data is contained in the .rds file decathlon.rds. Youâ€™ll need to use read_rds() from readr to open it.

# Call R file to process the rds file.

```{r}
source(here::here("R_scripts/read_rds_data.R"))
```

```{r}
decathlon_data  
```


# 1.1.2 Analysis questions
  ## 1 Who had the longest long jump seen in the data?
```{r}
decathlon_data %>% 
  filter(long_jump == max(long_jump))
```

  ## 2 What was the average 100m time in each competition?
```{r}
decathlon_data %>% 
  group_by(competition) %>%
   summarise(mean(x100m))
```
  
## 3 Who had the highest total points across both competitions?
```{r}
decathlon_data %>% 
  filter(points== max(points))
```
  ## 4 What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?
```{r}
rbind(decathlon_data %>% 
  filter(competition == "olympicg") %>%
  select(competition,competitor,shot_put) %>%
  group_by(competition, competitor) %>%
  arrange(desc(shot_put)) %>%
  head(3), 
  decathlon_data %>% 
  filter(competition == "decastar") %>%
  select(competition,competitor,shot_put) %>%
  group_by(competition, competitor) %>%
  arrange(desc(shot_put)) %>%
  head(3))



```
  
## 5 What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?

```{r}
rbind(decathlon_data  %>%
    filter(x400m < 50) %>%
    summarise(round(mean(points),2 )) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    paste( " average points where 400m < 50 secs"),
  decathlon_data  %>%
    filter(x400m >= 50) %>%
    summarise( round(mean(points),2)) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    paste( " average points where 400m >= 50 secs")
)

```

# 1.4 Task 4 - Halloween Candy Data
The data is in files boing-boing-candy-2015.xlxs, boing-boing-candy-2016.xlxs and boing-boing-candy-2017.xlxs. Bear in mind that this is trickier compared with tasks 1, 2 & 3.

```{r}

source(here::here("R_scripts/read_in_candy_data.R"))


```
```{r}
j <- 1
for(i in 1:nrow(candy_data_3)) {
  
    
      candy_data_3$which_country_do_you_live_in[i] =  
        candy_data_1$which_country_do_you_live_in[j]
      if(j == nrow(candy_data_1)){
        
          #We need to reset the candy_data_1 index
          j <- 1
          
      } else {
        
          j <- j + 1
          
      }

}
```


```{r}
candy_data_3 %>%
  group_by(which_country_do_you_live_in)  %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```


```{r}
candy_data_3 %>% filter(which_country_do_you_live_in == "usa")  %>%
  count()
```
